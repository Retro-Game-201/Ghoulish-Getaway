# Project Name: Ghoulish Getaway (tentative name)

This site is an in-browser Halloween-themed adventure/survival game. In this game, the player character's vehicle gets a flat tire, requiring them to seek help at the nearby haunted-looking mansion at the side of a deserted highway. To survive, the player must make appropriate choices to avoid classic horror-movie deaths.
