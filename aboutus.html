            <p class="introduction">Hey everyone! My name is Luke, I am 20 years old and do not have any previous experience besides Code 101 and 102. I am excited for this class because coding is very enjoyable for me and feels more like a hobby rather than a chore. I'm also excited to work towards expanding my knowledge in coding and for it to hopefully help me towards my future career.</p><br>

                style it to look like Windows 95 because I am into retro computing.</p><br>
