            <p class="introduction">Hello again! My name is Emma (she/her), and I live in North Liberty, IA. My previous
                background is in science. I majored in biology and chemistry in college, and have been working in lab
                with
                the University of Iowa for the last several years. I have been learning JavaScript for several months
                now,
                and I've taken Code 101 and Code 102, but otherwise I'm new to the field. I use a Windows 11 Version
                22H2. I
                am excited for this class to learn the frameworks that I have heard about before but not used.</p><br>

            <p class="introduction">Hey everyone! Introduced myself previously in code 102 but again my name is Luke, I
                am
                20 years old and do not have any previous experience besides Code 101 and 102. My computer operating
                system
                is windows 11 and my version number is 22H2. I am excited for this class because coding is very
                enjoyable
                for me and feels more like a hobby rather than a chore. I'm also excited to work towards expanding my
                knowledge in coding and for it to hopefully help me towards my future career.</p><br>

            <p class="introduction">Hello! My name is Ava, I'm from Cedar Rapids, IA, born and raised. I'm 19 years old
                and
                I have a background in music, with a little bit of programming experience in robotics. I use Windows 11,
                but
                style it to look like Windows 95 because I am into retro computing. I am excited to take this course and
                so
                far coding has been very fun for me. It might be stressful, but I'm keeping a positive mindset about it
                all!
                I'm looking forward to working with everyone for the duration of this course!</p><br>
